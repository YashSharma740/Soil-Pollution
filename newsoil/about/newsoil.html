                FOREST soil
                    </span><br> <br>
            Forest soils, where soil formation has been influenced by forest vegetation, are generally characterized by deeply rooted trees, significant litter layers or O horizons, recycling of organic matter and nutrients,including wood, and wide varieties of soil-dwelling organisms.There are also soils now covered with forest vegetation, often plantations, on lands that were not naturally forested.<br><br>

                <span>BLACK soil </span><br><br>
            Black soils are mineral soils which have a black surface horizon, enriched with organic carbon that is at least 25 cm deep. Two categories of black soils are recognized. The categories are distinguished to recognise the higher value, and thus greater need for protection, of some soils, while still including a wider range of soils within the overall Black Soil definition.<br><br>

                        ALLUVIAL soil
                    </span><br><br>
            Alluvial soil has the highest productivity with respect to other soils. It is present mostly along rivers and is carriedby its streams during weathering of rocks. The soil is generally covered by tall grasses and forests, as well as a number of crops, such as rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, maize, cotton, soybean, jute, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, etc. This soil has very soft strata with the lowest proportion of nitrogen and humus but with an adequate amount of phosphate.<br><br>

                        </span><br> <br>
             Arid soils have surface horizons with several unique characteristics. Many arid soils, for example, are covered by desert pavement that overlies vesicular A and E horizons. Other arid soils are covered by salt efflorescence in areas where shallow groundwater has risen by capillarity and evaporated at the surface. Still other arid soils are covered by microbiotic crusts or by blankets of aeolian sand or silt.<br><br>

                            LATERITE soil
                        </span><br><br>
            Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formedin hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content.They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock, usually when there are conditions of high temperatures, and heavy rainfall with alternate wet and dry periods.<br><br>

            The soil is one of the most important natural resources that nature has provided to humankind. It actually sustains life on the planet as it is an essential ingredient for growing plants. But have you noticed that not all soils look the same? This is because the soil has a large range of variety. In fact, there are thousands upon thousands of soil types in the world. There are a variety of reasons for these variations in soil.<br><br>
