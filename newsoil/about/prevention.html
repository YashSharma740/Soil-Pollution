    <h1>SOIL CONSERVATION</h1>
    <div class="big">
    
    <p class="a">
        Soil conservation is the prevention of loss of the topmost layer of the soil from erosion or prevention of reduced fertility caused by over usage
        , acidification, salinization or other chemical soil contamination.
        Slash-and-burn and other unsustainable methods of subsistence farming are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A consequence of deforestation
        is typically large-scale erosion, loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total desertification. Techniques for improved soil conservation include 
        crop rotation, cover crops, conservation tillage and planted windbreaks, affect both erosion and fertility. When plants die, they decay and
        become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service. Farmers have
        practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best 
        management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops, plant residues and grass margins in order to better address soil
        conservation. Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we 
        value the land and this can be changed by cultural adaptation. Soil carbon is a carbon sink, playing a role in climate change mitigation.

    <h2>Contour Ploughing</h2>
    <div class="ab">
        <div class="c">
            Contour bunding or contour farming or Contour ploughing is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following
            its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create<br> a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times 
            of heavy precipitation, allowing more time for the water to settle into the soil. In contour plowing, the<br> ruts made by the plow run
            perpendicular rather than parallel to the slopes, generally furrows <br>that curve around the land and are level. This method is also 
            known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar
            practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes. Contour ploughing has been proved to reduce 
            fertilizer loss, power and time consumption, and wear on machines, as well as to increase crop yields and reduces soil erosion.

            Soil erosion prevention practices such as this can drastically decrease negative effects associated with soil erosion such as reduced
            crop productivity, worsened water quality, lower effective reservoir water levels, flooding, and habitat destruction. Contour 
            farming is considered an active form <br>of sustainable agriculture.

    <h2>Terrace farming</h2>
    <p class="a">
        <!-- <div class="pk"> -->
        Terrace farming (also called step farming) is a method of farming that consists of different "steps" or terraces that were developed in
        various places around the world. The rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are an example and are considered a World Heritage Site.
        This method of farming uses "steps" that are built into the side of a mountain or hill. On each level, various crops are planted. When it
        rains, instead of washing away all of the nutrients in the soil, the nutrients are carried down to the next level. These steps prevent
        water from washing away the soil and plants. This system also allowed them to build aqueducts, which carried water to each level.

        The idea was also independently developed by the Inca people. The Incas built their aqueduct system so well that it is still used today.
        Terraced paddy fields are used widely in rice, wheat and barley farming in east, south, southwest, and southeast Asia, as well as the Mediterranean 
        Basin, Africa, and South America. Drier-climate terrace farming is common throughout the Mediterranean Basin, where they are used for 
        vineyards, olive trees, cork oak, and other crops.<br><br>

    <h2>Keyline Design</h2>
        <p class="a">
            Keyline design is a landscaping technique of maximizing the beneficial use of the water resources of a tract of land. The "keyline" 
            is a specific topographic feature related to the natural flow of water on the tract. Keyline design is a system of principles and 
            techniques of developing rural and urban landscapes to optimize use of their water resources.

            Australian farmer and engineer P. A. Yeomans invented and developed Keyline design in his books The Keyline Plan, The Challenge of 
            Landscape, 
            Water For Every Farm, and The City Forest.
            In a smooth, grassy valley, a location denominated the keypoint is identified at which the lower and leveller portion of the primary 
            valley floor suddenly steepens higher. The keyline of this primary valley is determined by pegging a contour line that conforms to 
            the natural shape of the valley through the keypoint, such that all points on the keyline are at the same elevation as the 
            keypoint. Contour plowing both above and below the keyline and parallel to it ipso facto is "off-contour", but the developing 
            pattern tends to drift rainwater runoff away from the center of the valley and, incidentally, prevent erosion of its soil.
            Keyline designs include irrigation dams equipped with through-the-wall lockpipe systems, gravity feed irrigation, stock water, and 
            yard water. Graded earthen channels may be interlinked to broaden the catchment areas of high dams, conserve the height of water, 
            and transfer rainfall runoff into the most efficient high dam sites. Roads follow both ridge lines and water channels to provide 
            easier movement across the land.<br><br>

        </p>
    
    <h2>Windbreaks</h2>    
        <p class="a">
            A windbreak (shelterbelt) is a planting usually made up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs planted in such a manner as to provide
            shelter from the wind and to protect soil from erosion. They are commonly planted in hedgerows around the edges of fields on farms. 
            If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save energy. Windbreaks are also 
            planted to help keep snow from drifting onto roadways or yards. Farmers sometimes use windbreaks to keep snow drifts on farm 
            land that will provide water when the snow melts in the spring. Other benefits include contributing to a microclimate around crops 
            (with slightly less drying and chilling at night), providing habitat for wildlife, and, in some regions, providing wood if the 
            trees are harvested.Windbreaks and intercropping can be combined in a farming practice referred to as alleycropping, or being 
            deployed along riparian buffer stripes. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees 
            provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and 
            Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.

            A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing 
            the visual incursion of the motorway, mitigating noise from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and 
            the road.Fences called "windbreaks" are also used. Normally made from cotton, nylon, canvas, and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to 
            have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel. The poles are then hammered into 
            the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or "wind fences" are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open 
            fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed, a reduction of wind 
            speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by 87.5%.<br><br>

    <h2>Crop Rotation</h2> 
        <p class="a">
            <div class="wn">
            Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. 
            This practice reduces the reliance of crops on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, along with the probability of developing
            resistant pests and weeds.

            Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, gradually depletes the soil of certain 
            nutrients and selects for both a highly competitive pest and weed community. Without balancing nutrient use and diversifying pest 
            and weed communities, the productivity of monocultures is highly dependent on external inputs that may be harmful to the soil's 
            fertility. Conversely, a well-designed crop rotation can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides by better using 
            ecosystem services from a diverse set of crops. Additionally, crop rotations can improve soil structure and organic matter, which 
            reduces erosion and increases farm system resilience.<br>
            Crop rotation systems may be enriched by the influences of other practices such as the addition of livestock and manure, 
            intercropping or multiple cropping, and is common in organic cropping systems.<br>
            It can be done in various ways as are following: 
            <img src="images/crop2.jpg" height="200px" width="550px" id="rx">&nbsp; &nbsp;
            </div>

            <h4>Incorporation of livestock</h4>

            Introducing livestock makes the most efficient use of critical sod and cover crops; livestock (through manure) are able to distribute 
            the nutrients in these crops throughout the soil rather than removing nutrients from the farm through the sale of hay.

            Mixed farming or the practice of crop cultivation with the incorporation of livestock can help manage crops in a rotation and 
            cycle nutrients. Crop residues provide animal feed, while the animals provide manure for replenishing crop nutrients and draft 
            power. These processes promote internal nutrient cycling and minimize the need for synthetic fertilizers and large-scale machinery. 
            As an additional benefit, the cattle, sheep and/or goat provide milk and can act as a cash crop in the times of economic hardship.
            <h4>Intercropping</h4>
            Multiple cropping systems, such as intercropping or companion planting, offer more diversity and complexity within the same season 
            or rotation. An example of companion planting is the three sisters, the inter-planting of corn with pole beans and vining squash or 
            pumpkins. In this system, the beans provide nitrogen; the corn provides support for the beans and a "screen" against squash vine 
            borer; the vining squash provides a weed suppressive canopy and a discouragement for corn-hungry raccoons.

            Double-cropping is common where two crops, typically of different species, are grown sequentially in the same growing season, or 
            where one crop (e.g. vegetable) is grown continuously with a cover crop (e.g. wheat).[4] This is advantageous for small farms, 
            which often cannot afford to leave cover crops to replenish the soil for extended periods of time, as larger farms can. When 
            multiple cropping is implemented on small farms, these systems can maximize benefits of crop rotation on available land resources.

            <h4>Organic farming</h4>
            Crop rotation is a required practice, in the United States, for farm seeking organic certification.[14] The “Crop Rotation Practice 
            Standard” for the National Organic Program under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, section §205.205, states.<br>

            Farmers are required to implement a crop rotation that maintains or builds soil organic matter, works to control pests, manages and 
            conserves nutrients, and protects against erosion. Producers of perennial crops that aren’t rotated may utilize other practices, 
            such as cover crops, to maintain soil health.

            In addition to lowering the need for inputs (by controlling for pests and weeds and increasing available nutrients), crop rotation 
            helps organic growers increase the amount of biodiversity their farms. Biodiversity is also a requirement of organic 
            certification, however, there are no rules in place to regulate or reinforce this standard. Increasing the biodiversity of 
            crops has beneficial effects on the surrounding ecosystem and can host a greater diversity of fauna, insects, and beneficial 
            microorganisms in the soil as found by McDaniel et al 2014 and Lori et al 2017. Some studies point to increased nutrient 
            availability from crop rotation under organic systems compared to conventional practices as organic practices are less likely 
            to inhibit of beneficial microbes in soil organic matter.While multiple cropping and intercropping benefit from many of the 
            same principals as crop rotation, they do not satisfy the requirement under the NOP.
        </p>
        <h2> Soil-Conservation Farming </h2>
        <p class="a">
            Soil-conservation farming involves no-till farming, "green manures" and other soil-enhancing practices which make it hard for the 
            soils to be equalized. Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of barren lands. They can revive damaged soil, minimize 
            erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect
             crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and 
             cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of soil organic matter.

            Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons
             to fully 
            recover, even in optimal circumstances.

            Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires
             new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers
              have contended that no-till complicates pest control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are 
              hard to manage.
        </p>
        <h2>Reducing the use of Pesticides</h2>
        <p class="a">
            The use of pesticides can contaminate the soil, and nearby vegetation and water sources for a long time. They affect soil 
            structure and (biotic and abiotic) composition. Differentiated taxation schemes are among the options investigated in 
            the academic literature to reducing their use.
            Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones 
            and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering (mostly of crops), and methods of interfering with insect breeding.
            Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.
            These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is 
            registering reduced-risk pesticides in increasing numbers.
        </p>
        <H2>Salinity M5anagement</H2>
        <p class="a">
            Salinity in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt
             breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.[citation needed]

            The ions responsible for salination are: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and chlorine (Cl−). 
            Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth's arable land.[14] Soil salinity adversely affects crop metabolism 
            and erosion usually follows.
            
            Salinity occurs on drylands from overirrigation and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts 
            in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known
            case of shallow saline water table capillary action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change 
            in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to
            soil salination.
            
            Use of humic acids may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation.[citation needed] Humic acids can fix both
             anions and cations and eliminate them from root zones.[citation needed]
            
            Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions can be used to lower water tables and thus reduce the rate of capillary and
            evaporative enrichment of surface salts. Salt-tolerant plants include saltbush, a plant found in much of North America and in the
            Mediterranean regions of Europe.
        </p>
        <h2>Soil Organisms</h2>
        <P class="a">
        When worms excrete feces in the form of casts, a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible 
        for root uptake. Earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen, seven times richer in available phosphates and eleven
         times richer in available potash than the surrounding upper 150 millimetres (5.9 in) of soil. The weight of casts produced may be 
         greater than 4.5 kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil porosity, creating channels that enhance the
        processes of aeration and drainage.

        Other important soil organisms include nematodes, mycorrhiza and bacteria. A quarter of all the animal species live underground. 
        According to the 2020 Food and Agriculture Organization’s report "State of knowledge of soil biodiversity – Status, challenges and 
        potentialities", there are major gaps in knowledge about biodiversity in soils.

        Degraded soil requires synthetic fertilizer to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and 
        other pollutants into rivers and streams.

        Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold 20,000 gallons more water per acre.
        </P>
        <h2>Mineralization</h2>
        <p class="a">
            To allow plants full realization of their phytonutrient potential, active mineralization of the soil is sometimes undertaken. 
            This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to combat mineral depletion. 
            A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such as phosphorus and more exotic substances such as zinc 
            and selenium. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.

            Flooding can bring significant sediments to an alluvial plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life 
            or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a floodplain is a natural process that can 
            rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.
