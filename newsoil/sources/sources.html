                   <h1><i>SOURCES of SOIL POLLUTION</i></h1>
                <H2>NATURAL, GEOGENIC SOURCES</H2>
       <p class="yr">
            It is crucial to separate background values from baseline values when defining
             the extent of contamination in areas where environmental legislation has not
            yet established intervention limits for all environmental matrices (Albanese et al.,
            2007). Background values indicate geogenic natural content, while baseline values
            indicate the actual content of an element in the superficial environment at any
            given point (Reimann, Filzmoser and Garrett, 2005; Salminen and Gregorauskiene, 2000).
            Background concentrations in the soils of a region will be strongly related to the
            pedo-geochemical fraction and the dynamics of the environment that led to the
            formation of the soil. The use of averages or global intervals is therefore not suitable
            for determining background levels at the regional or local levels (Horckmans et al., 2005;
            Paye, Mello and Melo, 2012). For example, heavy metals in soils can vary over two to three
            orders of magnitude, considering the natural variation in the concentration of trace
            metals within the parent rock type (Shacklette and Boerngen, 1984).
            Several soil parent materials are natural sources of certain heavy metals and other
            elements, such as radionuclides, and these can pose a risk to the environment and
            human health at elevated concentrations. Arsenic (As) contamination is one of the
            major environmental problems around the world. Natural sources of As include
            volcanic releases (Albanese et al., 2007) and weathering of As‑containing minerals and
            ores (Díez et al., 2009), but also naturally occurring mineralized zones of arsenopyrite
            (gossans), formed by the weathering of sulphide‑bearing rock (Scott, Ashley and Lawie,
            2001). Many of these minerals present a high spatial variability and many of them
            can be found in higher concentrations in deeper layers (Li et al., 2017). However, As is
            slightly bioaccessible when coming from natural sources
       </p>
       <h2>INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES</h2>
        <p class="yt">
            The range of chemicals used in industrial activities is vast, as is their impact on the
            environment.
            Industrial activities release pollutants to the atmosphere, water and soil. Gaseous
            pollutants and radionuclides are released to the atmosphere and can enter the soil
            directly through acid rain or atmospheric deposition; former industrial land can
            be polluted by incorrect chemical storage or direct discharge of waste into the soil;
            water and other fluids used for cooling in thermal power plants and many other
            industrial processes can be discharged back to rivers, lakes and oceans, causing
            thermal pollution and dragging heavy metals and chlorine that affect aquatic
            life and other water bodies. Heavy metals from anthropogenic activities are also
            frequent in industrial sites and can arise from dusts and spillages of raw materials,
            wastes, final product, fuel ash, and fires (Alloway, 2013).
            According to the European Directive concerning integrated pollution prevention
            and control (IPPC) (EC, 1996), potentially polluting activities can be grouped into
            six main categories: 1) energy industries; 2) production and processing of metals;
            3) mineral industry; 4) chemical industry and chemical installations; 5) waste
            management; and 6) other activities (which include paper and board production,
            manufacture of fibres or textiles, tanning of hides and skins, slaughterhouses,
            intensive poultry or pig rearing, installations using organic solvents, and the
            production of carbon or graphite) (García-Pérez et al., 2007).
            Salinization, another major threat to global soils, affects many soils which are close
            to certain industrial activities, mainly those associated with chlor-alkali, textiles,
            glass, rubber production, animal hide processing and leather tanning, metal
            processing, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas drilling, pigment manufacture, ceramic
            manufacture, and soap and detergent production (Saha et al., 2017).
        </p>
        <h2> MINING</h2>
        <p class="yt">
            Mining has had a major impact on soil, water and biota since ancient times (FAO
            and ITPS, 2015). Many documented examples can be found of heavily contaminated
            soils associated with mining activities around the world (Alloway, 2013).
            Metal smelting to separate minerals has introduced many pollutants into the soil.
            Mining and smelting facilities release huge quantities of heavy metals and other
            toxic elements to the environment; these persist for long periods, long after the end
            of these activities (Ogundele et al., 2017).
            Toxic mining wastes are stocked up in tailings, mainly formed by fine particles that
            can have different concentrations of heavy metals. These polluted particles can be
            dispersed by wind and water erosion, sometimes reaching agricultural soils. For
            example, Mileusnić et al. found high levels of lead and copper in agricultural fields
            located near a tailings dam in Namibia (Mileusnić et al., 2014). Toxic concentrations of
            chromium and nickel were also found in agricultural soils near an abandoned
            chromite-asbestos mine waste in India and in crops grown in those soils, resulting
            in a high risk to human and livestock health (Kumar and Maiti, 2015).
            The use of phosphate rocks, which are naturally rich in radioactivity, in the
            production of fertilizers generates a by-product called phosphogypsum, which
            maintains nearly 80 percent of its original radioactivity due to 238U decay products
            such as radon, 226Ra, and polonium, 210Po. These industries generate a radioactive
            source of pollution, which constitutes a threat to the surrounding ecosystems and
            organisms (Bolívar, García-Tenorio and García-León, 1995).
        </p>
        <h2>URBAN AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES</h2>
        <p class="yt">
            The widespread development of infrastructure such as housing, roads and railways
            has considerably contributed to environmental degradation. Their more evident
            negative effects on soil are soil sealing and land consumption. Apart from these
            known soil threats, another major impact of infrastructure activities is the entry
            into the soil system of different pollutants. Despite its being a major threat, soil
            pollution from infrastructure activities has received very minor consideration in
            terms of planning and impact assessment.
            Activities linked to transportation in and around urban centers constitute one of
            the main sources of soil pollution, not only because of the emissions from internal
            combustion engines that reach soils at more than a 100 m distance by atmospheric
            deposition and petrol spills, but also from the activities and the changes that result
            from them as a whole (Mirsal, 2008). Splashes generated by traffic during rainfall events
            and runoff, which may be significant if the drainage system is not well maintained,
            may translocate particles rich in heavy metals from the corrosion of metal vehicle
            parts, tires and pavement abrasion (Venuti, Alfonsi and Cavallo, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015b) and
            other pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, rubber and plasticderived
            compounds (Kumar and Kothiyal, 2016; Wawer et al., 2015). Soil pollution associated
            with roads and highways is especially important in urban and peri-urban soils,
            and can be a major threat when food production occurs in adjacent areas. Foliar
            deposition and root uptake and transfer to above‑ground tissues of bioavailable
            heavy metals are the main processes observed in roadside soil (Hashim et al., 2017; Kim
            et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015b). Grazing in roadside soils is also quite common, and the
            ingestion of contaminated soil and plants constitutes potential dietary transfer of
            pollutants affecting animal and human health (Cruz et al., 2014).
            A major legacy source of soil pollution associated with transport is lead
            contamination of soils from leaded gasoline. Mielke and Reagan cite research
            that over 10 million tonnes of lead was transferred to the global environment via
            the motor vehicle fleet, about 5.9 million tonnes in the United States of America
            alone (Mielke and Reagan, 1998). The soil contamination that resulted from this was
            concentrated around roads and is especially high in core urban areas.
        </p>
        <H2>WASTE AND SEWAGE GENERATION AND DISPOSAL</H2>
        <p class="yt">
            As the global population increases, so does the generation of waste. In developing
            and least developed countries, high rates of population growth and increasing
            waste and sludge production, combined with lack of municipal services that deal
            with waste management, create a dangerous situation. According to a World Bank
            report (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012), the global production of municipal solid waste
            was estimated to be 1.3 billion tonnes per year in 2012, varying from 0.45 kg per
            person and per day in sub-Saharan Africa to 2.2 kg per capita annually in the
            Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD) countries.
            Future predictions are worrying, however, as waste production is expected to rise
            to 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025.
            Municipal waste disposal in landfills and incineration are the two most common
            ways to manage waste. In both cases, many pollutants, such as heavy metals,
            polyaromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products
            and their derivative products accumulate in the soil (Swati et al., 2014), either directly
            from landfill leachates that may be polluting soil and under groundwater, or by ash
            fallout from incinerating plants (Mirsal, 2008). Baderna et al. discovered a complex
            mixture of pollutants in a landfill leachate that alters groundwater quality and in
            turn affects the food chain (Baderna et al., 2011).
            Establishments that recycle lead batteries have been identified as major sources
            of soil contamination around the world. This is especially the case in Africa,
            where the lead battery industry has notably expanded in the last few years and
            will continue to grow, but where regulations are weak or absent (Gottesfeld et al., 2018).
            The proximity of lead battery industries and recycling plants to communities poses
            a high risk to human health, as was demonstrated by blood samples where lead
            levels exceeded screening level criteria (US Agency for Toxic Subtances and Disease Registry,
            2011; Zahran et al., 2013).
            The twenty-first century has resulted in improvements in communication and
            important technological developments. The production of electrical and electronic
            equipment is growing rapidly in the world and will continue to grow, with
            developing countries becoming major producers within the next decade (Robinson,
            2009). However, once devices become obsolete or are no longer functioning, they
            eventually become waste. Electronic waste, or e‑waste, contains valuable elements,
            such as copper and gold, but also many other hazardous substances that make it
            impossible to treat it in a similar manner as regular urban waste. In Europe and
            North America, the majority of e-waste remains unrecycled (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-
            Díaz and Hopp, 2008; Sthiannopkao and Wong, 2013), while e-waste has become a source of
            income in developing or emerging industrialized countries. Itai et al. reported high
            concentrations of heavy metals and of rare metalloids (In, Sb, Bi) in an e-waste
            recycling site in Ghana, indicating that these metalloids should be included in risk
            1 | WHAT IS SOIL POLLUTION? 13
            assessment approaches (Itai et al., 2014). Formal recycling centres comprise only 25
            percent of the industry, however, and e-waste is mostly recycled in informal sectors
            using primitive techniques such as burning cables for the harvesting of copper.
            These techniques release a multitude of hazardous substances (flame retardants,
            dioxin-like compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals) without
            taking into account protective measures for the environment or for human health
            (Perkins et al., 2014).

        <h2>MILITARY ACTIVITIES AND WARS</h2>
        <p class="yt">
            Until the twentieth century, most conflicts were of local magnitude and had relatively
            little impact on soils. However, modern warfare makes use of non‑degradable
            weapons of destruction and of chemicals that can remain in the affected soils for
            centuries after the end of the conflict (FAO and ITPS, 2015). The nature of soils can be
            considerably modified by warfare activities in both wartime and times of peace due
            to military activities such as test-firing facilities. Total and sometimes even partial
            recovery of these soils can take many years, and in some cases even centuries (Certini,
            Scalenghe and Woods, 2013).
            The First and Second World Wars left Europe with a significant heritage of
            pollution (land mines, remains of ammunitions and leftover chemicals, radioactive
            and biological toxic agents), not only in the battlefields but also in sites such as
            shooting areas, barracks and storage of armaments. This legacy has made the soils
            in some of these areas unsuitable for any kind of exploitation or service provision.
            There are approximately 110 million mines and other unexploded ordnance
            (UXO) scattered in 64 countries on all continents, remnants of wars from the early
            twentieth century up until today (Kobayashi, 2012).
            The disposal of munitions, and the lack of care in their manufacturing caused
            by the urgency of the situation at the time of their production, can contaminate
            soils for extended periods of time. There is little published evidence on this type
            of contamination, largely because of restrictions placed by governments of manycountries on the publication of material related to warfare. In Berlin, for example,
            more than a thousand hectares presented high levels of contamination (Schafer, 1995);
            Gruinard Island, in western Scotland, is still polluted with anthrax spores that were
            used as potential biological weapons, despite remediation efforts (Szasz, 1995; WHO,
            2008). Mustard gas stored during the Second World War has also contaminated
            some sites for up to 50 years (Watson and Griffin, 1992).
        </p>
        <h2>AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK ACTIVITIES</h2>
        <p class="yt">
            The different agricultural sources of soil pollutants include agrochemical sources,
            such as fertilizers and animal manure, and pesticides (Figure 4). Trace metals from
            these agrochemicals, such as, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg, are also considered soil pollutants
            as they can impair plant metabolism and decrease crop productivity. Water sources
            for irrigation can also cause soil pollution if they consist of waste water and urban
            sewage. Excess N and heavy metals are not only a source of soil pollution, but also
            a threat to food security, water quality and human health, when they enter the food
            chain (FAO and ITPS, 2015).Point sources of pollution in agricultural settings include accidental spills of
            hydrocarbons in agricultural fields used as fuels for machines or of agrochemicals
            during their transportation and storage stages.
            As mentioned earlier, livestock production can also be a source of pollution,
            especially if the waste is not properly managed and disposed of: the urine and faeces
            may contain parasites and medical substances that can persist and accumulate in
            the soil (Zhang et al., 2015a). Many medical substances are lipolytic and not readily
            degradable and therefore have the potential to be retained in the sludge or the
            manure, which in turn may be used as fertilizer. Such retention can greatly affect
            microorganisms and other beneficial organisms in the soil (Halling-Sørensen et al., 1998).
            Excessive application of fertilizers and manure or inefficient use of the main
            nutrients (N and P) in fertilizers are the main contributors to environmental issues
            linked to agriculture (Kanter, 2018). These two nutrients are a source of diffuse
            pollution. Excess N can also be lost to the atmosphere through greenhouse gas
            emissions, and excess P contributes to the eutrophication of neighbouring
            sources of water. Excessive fertilizer usage can lead to soil salinity, heavy metal
            accumulation, water eutrophication and accumulation of nitrate, which can be a
            source of environmental pollution but also a threat to human health. The fertilizer
            industry is also considered to be a source of heavy metals such as Hg, Cd, As, Pb,
            Cu, Ni and Cu, and natural radionuclides like 238U, 232Th and 210Po. Proper handling
            and management of fertilizer is crucial to avoid polluting the soil (Stewart et al., 2005).
