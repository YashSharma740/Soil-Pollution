    <h1>MAIN POLLUTANTS IN SOIL</h1>
    <div class="ab">
        <p class="a">
        The release of pollutants to the environment, as has been mentioned, usually
        originates from anthropogenic processes. Even if some elements and compounds
        occur naturally in soils, human interventions are the main drivers of soil pollution.
        The following sections discuss only a small subset of the most common pollutants
        affecting agricultural areas, and the properties that make these compounds
        pollutants. Pollutants have been divided by their chemical characteristics, but
        some of the categories presented here overlap. Swartjes proposed a systematic
        categorization of pollutants  that may be useful in better understanding
        them.<br> <br>

        <h2>HEAVY METALS AND METALLOIDS</h2><br>
        <p class="b">
        The term “heavy metals” refers to the group of metals and metalloids of relatively
        high atomic mass (>4.5 g/cm3) such as Pb, Cd, Cu, Hg, Sn, and Zn, that can cause
        toxicity problems. Other non-metals that are often considered together with
        heavy metals include As, antimony (Sb) and selenium (Se) (Kemp, 1998). These
        elements naturally occur at low concentrations in soils. Many of them are essential
        micronutrients for plants, animals and humans, but at high concentrations may
        cause phytotoxicity and harm human health because of their non‑biodegradable
        nature, which causes them to readily accumulate in tissues and living organisms.
        The main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals are industrial areas, mine
        tailings, disposal of high metal wastes, leaded gasoline and paints, application of
        fertilizers, animal manures, sewage sludge, pesticides, wastewater irrigation, coal
        combustion residues, spillage of petrochemicals, and atmospheric deposition from
        varied sources.Heavy metals are the most persistent and complex kind of pollutants to remediate
        in nature. They not only degrade the quality of the atmosphere, water bodies, and
        food crops, but also threaten the health and well‑being of animals and human
        beings. Metals accumulate in the tissues of living organisms because unlike most
        organic compounds they are not subject to metabolic breakdown. Among the
        heavy metals, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu are relatively more toxic to plants, and As, Cd, Pb,
        Cr and Hg are relatively more toxic to higher animals.The most important elements to consider in terms of food‑chain contamination are
        As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Se (McLaughlin, Parker and Clarke, 1999). The main sources of As in soils
        are agrochemical compounds and mining and smelting activities, but they can also
        be introduced in manure originating from livestock feed with As‑rich additives.
        Some parent materials are rich in As and therefore their weathering can also be a
        source of As in high concentrations.
        Trace metals from inorganic (Cu‑based) and organic pesticides represent a major
        environmental and toxicological concern (Komárek et al., 2010). Cu is easily immobilized
        by soil organic matter (SOM) and Fe- and Mn‑(hydro)oxides, remaining at high
        concentrations on upper layers of soils. However, fungicide-derived Cu has been
        found in large amounts in the potentially available fraction of the soil.

    </p>
    <h2>NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS</h2>
    <p class="c">
        Nitrogen (N) is an essential component of all living structures such as proteins,
        DNA, RNA, hormones, enzymes and vitamins. It occurs in both organic and
        inorganic forms, and in many different oxidation states. Its available forms differ
        depending on the specific organism. Unreactive forms such as gaseous nitrogen
        (N2) can be assimilated through microbial activity. Plants need more chemically
        available forms, such as ammonium (NH4
        +) and nitrate (NO3
        -), while animals require
        complex forms, such as amino acids and nucleic acids .
        Phosphorus (P) is one of the main macronutrients for all living organisms. It forms
        part of biological molecules, such as DNA and RNA, and it is used to transport
        cellular energy via adenosine triphosphate (ATP).In order to feed the increasing population and to supply the nutrient needs of the
        many deficient soils around the world, additions of N, P and potassium (K) through
        synthetic fertilizers were widely adopted through the twentieth century.Fertilizer demand has increased globally supported by global
        economic growth, leading to an excessive application of fertilizers following the
        idea “the more, the better.” According to FAO, fertilizer global consumption by
        2018 is forecast to reach 200 million tonnes, with over 50 percent of global fertilizer
        consumption concentrated in China, the United States of America, and India . However, there is not a linear correlation between an increase in the amount
        of fertilizer applied to agricultural soils and an increase in crop production; on the
        contrary, increases may result in low nutrient use efficiency and in turn lower crop
        yields, and may cause acute environmental problems.
        <img src="images/nitrotable.jpg" height="600px" width="1400px" id="ni">
        Nitrogen and phosphorus become pollutants when they are applied in excess
        to agricultural soils in the form of fertilizers, or in areas of intensive livestock
        production . These nutrients are
        able to leach into the groundwater or be transported to surface water bodies by
        runoff, causing eutrophication or leading to high nitrate concentrations and related
        environmental and human health problems. Many heavy metals have also been documented
        in phosphate and nitrate fertilizers including As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Zn.While nutrients are essential to crop production, when they are applied in excess they
        can have negative effects on yields. Nitrogen increases chlorophyll production, and
        energy for flower growth and root elongation is redirected to foliage proliferation,
        causing disorders in plants and making them more vulnerable to pathogen attacks.
        It can also affect crop nutrient balance. Nitrogen pollution influences
        soil organic matter decomposition, as it affects microbial community composition
        and activities, as well
        as soil acidity and salinity.
    </p>
    <h2>PESTICIDES</h2>
    <p class="c">
        Pesticides are applied to reduce crop losses due to insect pests, weeds and pathogens,
        and thus to guarantee global food supplies . Pesticides include
        but are not limited to insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, molluscicides,
        nematicides, and plant growth regulators.Without pesticide use, crop losses have been estimated to vary from 32 percent for
        cereals to 78 percent in fruit production. Pesticides are applied not only on
        agricultural lands; they also have a great importance on human health protection,
        for example for sanitary pest control of vector‑borne diseases. They are also used
        to keep infrastructures free of damaging insects and weeds, such as for preventing
        the attack of wood buildings by termites, or for keeping roadside and train tracks
        clean in order to help in avoiding accidents (Aktar, Sengupta and Chowdhury, 2009). Their
        use is not homogeneously distributed around the globe, mainly because of their
        cost and because pests vary by climatic and geographic region. According to
        FAOSTAT, FAO’s Corporate Database for Substantive Statistical Data , some low and middle income countries have increased their consumption
        of pesticides in the last decade. Bangladesh, for example, has increased the use of
        pesticides by four times, while Rwanda and Ethiopia have increased theirs by over
        six times. This amount goes up to ten times in the Sudan. Once again, the
        problem arises when a misuse of pesticides occurs: when they are applied in higher
        amounts than needed and using practices that contribute to their spreading into
        the environment, such as spraying with not suitable/not maintained/not calibrated
        application equipment or by planes into vast regions, affecting inhabitants and
        non-target organisms.
        <img src="images/worldtable.jpg" height="600px" width="1400px">
        Pesticides can be either organic or inorganic synthetic molecules. They are
        classified on the basis of their chemical structures, their mode of action, their way
        of entry into the body, and their target organisms. Their toxicological effects on
        pests depend on their chemical composition, which in turn affects their interaction
        with soil components. According to their chemical structure, pesticides
        can be divided into twelve distinct groups, with the main pesticides in each group
        listed below:

    <h2>POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS</h2>
    <p class="c">
        Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of persistent, semi-volatile
        organic pollutants.
        Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons represent a broad group of physicochemically
        different molecules made of two or more unsubstituted benzene rings fused together
        when a pair of carbon atoms is shared between them. The most frequent PAHs are
        anthracene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, pyrene, phenantrene and benzopyrene
        . The very low water solubility of PAHs and the slow mass‑transfer rates
        from solid phase may limit their availability to microorganisms, thus hindering
        natural attenuation by microbial processes. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
        accumulate in soils because of their persistence and hydrophobicity and tend to
        be retained in the soil for long periods of time. For that reason, most PAHs are
        components of POPs and are widespread in air, water, soils, and sediments .Low‑molecular‑weight PAHs, with two or three rings, are volatile and
        occur mainly in the atmosphere, whereas those of medium and high molecular
        weight are partitioned between the atmosphere and particles, depending on the
        temperature .
        Incomplete combustion of coal, gas, oil, and garbage; pyrolysis of organic materials
        by industries, agriculture and traffic; diagenetic alteration processes of natural
        organic matter (OM); long‑term wastewater irrigation; reused sewage sludge; and
        fertilizer use in agricultural production all result in high concentrations of PAHs in
        agricultural soils. For example, in western German forests,
        brown coal strip-mining sites have been identified as the main sources of low
        weight PAHs, while Khalili et al. identified two- and three‑ring
        PAHs as major products originating from multiple emission sources, including
        coke ovens, diesel and gasoline engines, and wood combustion. Traffic emissions and fossil fuel combustion are the main identified
        sources of PAHs in urban areas.<br><br>
        <img src="images/fosiil.jpg" height="400px" width="700px" id="fp"><br><br>
        Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted attention due to their high toxicity,
        Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted attention due to their high toxicity,
        mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and widespread presence in the environment. Although there are many PAHs, scientists and regulators have focused on 16
        compounds that have been identified as carcinogenic. Recently,
        however, many different stakeholders support the implementation of broader
        regulations that include not only other toxic PAHs but also heterocyclic aromatic
        compounds and alkyl-derivatives. In a global analysis of
        PAH distribution pattern in soils, Wilcke found that Germany and Czechia are
        more contaminated with PAHs than all other parts of the world that have been
        studied, such as China, the Russian Federation, Thailand, the United States of
        America, Brazil and Ghana. In a more recent study, Loganathan and
        Lam found higher concentrations of PAHs in soils in India compared to those in
        Africa, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Brazil, the Russian Federation, Canada and
        Australia. Thus, PAHs are ubiquitous contaminants in soils,
        but their concentration varies depending on the distance from the pollutant source,
        soil properties and climatic conditions.

    <h2>PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS</h2>
    <p class="c">Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemical substances that persist in the
        environment, bioaccumulate through the food chain, and have adverse effects on
        human health and the environment . There are many thousands of POPs,
        and their origins are numerous, as they have been used in agriculture, disease
        control, manufacturing and many industrial processes. POPs include chlorinated
        and brominated aromatics, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which
        have been useful in a variety of industrial applications, for example in electrical
        transformers and large capacitors, as hydraulic and heat exchange fluids, and as
        additives to paints and lubricants; and organochlorine pesticides such as DDT
        and its metabolites, which are still used to control mosquitoes that carry malaria
        in some parts of the world. Other chemicals, unintentionally produced, such as
        dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and –furans), which result from
        some industrial processes and from combustion (municipal and medical waste
        incineration and backyard burning of household waste) are also included in this
        category.
        Persistent organic pollutants are mainly hydrophobic and lipophilic compounds,
        and therefore present great affinity to organic matter and lipid membranes of cells
        and hence they can be stored in fatty tissue. The Stockholm
        Convention, a global treaty for protecting humans and the environment against
        POP contamination, has listed more than 20 POPs so far.
        Persistent organic pollutants enter the food chain by accumulating in the body fat of
        living organisms and becoming more concentrated as they move from one organism
        to the next in a process known as “biomagnification”.
        Persistent organic pollutants also have high mobility: they can easily penetrate
        water in its gaseous phase during warm weather and volatilize from soils into the
        atmosphere. This can then lead to their deposition many miles away from the
        release point as temperatures cool. Examples of POP contamination
        through mobility include the discovery of significant amounts of POPs in isolated
        regions in the Arctic. As a general rule, the more
        chlorinated the molecule, the less water soluble and volatile it is. Polychlorinated
        biphenyls are poorly taken up by plants but susceptible to bioaccumulation by
        animals, mainly in adipose tissue and breast milk.
        Since the publication of the book Silent Spring, a multitude of studies
        have focused on the effects of POPs on living organisms and the environment. Yet there is still a lack of information
        on the presence of POPs in soils in developing countries (Fiedler et al., 2013). Pollution
        by POPs could be expected to be significant in dumping sites of developing Asian
        countries, considering their poor management of municipal wastes and extensive
        use of such chemicals in the past .By the late 1970s most governments had banned PCB production, but an extensive
        environmental contamination still persists  as a consequence of accidental
        spills and leaks due to improper transport, storage and disposal. Despite their use and production having significantly
        been reduced since the adoption of the Stockholm Convention, POPs persist in
        the environment, affecting food security, health and the environment for many
        more generations. Global agreement and increasing efforts and cooperation to remove POPs from soils is essential in preventing future pollution
        of crops and animals.
        

    </p>
    <h2>RADIONUCLIDES</h2>
    <P class="c">
        Radionuclides are present in the environment both as a naturally occurring
        substance and as one of anthropogenic origin. The emission of ionizing radiation during the decay of active atoms is the
        main contamination route of radionuclides, considering their long half-lives .The most common natural and anthropogenic radionuclides found in soils are 40K,
        238U, 232Th, 90Sr and 137Cs. Anthropogenic sources of
        nuclear pollution include the global fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons
        testing during the middle decades of the last century, operations of nuclear facilities
        and non‑nuclear industry (e.g. coal fire power plants, nuclear waste handling and
        disposal, and mining of radioactive ores , mineral fertilizers  and nuclear accidents (Three
        Mile Island, the United States of America (1979); Chernobyl, Ukrainian SSR (1986);
        Goiânia, Brazil (1987); Tokaimura (1999) and Fukushima (2011), Japan).Radionuclides in the soil are taken up by plants, thereby becoming available for
        further redistribution within the food chain (Zhu and Shaw, 2000). For example, after the
        Fukushima accident, strict monitoring of agricultural products has been conducted
        to ensure food safety (Nihei, 2013). The monitoring demonstrated a fast decay in
        radionuclide content in vegetal products, but also discovered that radionuclides
        remained bioavailable in soils long after initial contamination . Although topsoil removal is
        highly recommended after a major radioactive accident, it may be not possible
        for large areas as it would generate a huge amount of radioactive waste. For that
        reason, agricultural areas are often abandoned for many years. Agricultural
        countermeasures must be applied to reduce the transfer of radionuclides in the food
        chain and to facilitate the return of potentially affected soils to their agricultural
        use. The transfer of radionuclides to animal‑derived
        food products has also been analyzed, but the
        mechanisms involved are not yet completely clear or well understood.
    </P>
    <h2>EMERGING POLLUTANTS</h2>
    <p class="c">
        Emerging pollutants (EPs) refers to a large number of synthetic or naturally
        occurring chemicals that have recently appeared in the environment and are
        not commonly monitored. They have the potential to enter the
        environment and to cause known or suspected adverse ecological and/or human
        health effects. Emerging pollutants may well become pollutants of emerging
        concern, as new facts or information have demonstrated that they are posing a risk
        to the environment and human health. Emerging pollutants
        encompass chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, hormones
        and toxins, among others, and biological pollutants, such as micropollutants in
        soils, which include bacteria and viruses.
        The anthropogenic production of chemicals has experienced a rapid growth
        globally since the 1970s. In the European Union in 2016, the chemical industry
        produced 319 million tonnes of hazardous and non‑hazardous chemicals. Of these,
        117 million tonnes were deemed to be hazardous to the environment.
        Global production is projected to increase annually by approximately 3.4 percent
        until 2030, and non-OECD countries will be much greater contributors
        to this production in the future. Production and use of hazardous
        chemicals have been reduced over the last ten years; however, the uncertainties
        that still remain and the lack of information from many developing countries make
        it impossible to conclude that risks to the environment and human health have
        been successfully reduced.<br><br>
        <img src="images/graph.jpg" height="600px" width="1000px" id="mp"> <br><br>
        As an example, properties such as the adsorption behaviour of pharmaceuticals
        can vary vastly in different soil types as their occurrence in both ionized and unionized
        forms affects their interaction with different compounds in the soil . The abundance of a high
        number of potentially toxic emerging pollutants
        in the environment reinforces the need to better understand their occurrence, fate
        and ecological impact.
        Since the sources of EPs are varied and numerous, their nature, physical and
        chemical properties are also diverse. These include volatility, polarity, adsorption
        properties, persistence and their interaction with the environment. The main
        groups of emerging organic pollutants affecting agricultural soils are described
        below.Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are a class of emerging
        chemical contaminants that have been used extensively for decades. There are
        more than 4 000 pharmaceutical and chemical products, including pharmaceutical
        drugs, diagnostic agents, cosmetics, fragrances, nutritional supplements and
        additives used in many household cleaning items. Many PPCPs are biologically
        active compounds, designed to interact with hormonal processes or
        living tissues; for this reason it is important to know their fate, effects and potential
        risks when they are released into the environment.
        Since the late 1990s, detection of PPCPs in environmental matrices has been
        increasingly reported worldwide. PPCPs enter urban wastewater streams but they are
        not efficiently eliminated by conventional treatment technologies,
        and end up accumulating in sludge. Municipal biosolids have been found to be a
        sink for many PPCPs, and their land application as fertilizers may introduce these
        compounds into the environment, causing harm to beneficial microorganisms and
        affecting nutrient cycles. Limited information is available on the concentrations
        of PPCPs in soils amended with biosolids, even though their persistence in soil is
        significant. Another problem associated
        with PPCPs is the presence of antimicrobial agents and their potential to promote
        bacterial resistance in the environment.
